# **Flashcards for Learning STEM Vocabulary**

## **Overview**
This project is a simple web application designed to help users learn STEM vocabulary through interactive flashcards. Each card contains a question or a term on the front side, and when clicked, it flips to reveal the answer. The goal is to make learning engaging and visually interactive, especially for beginners interested in STEM subjects.

## **Problem Addressed**
Learning STEM concepts can be challenging for students, especially when trying to memorize complex terms and definitions. Flashcards have been proven to be an effective tool for helping users reinforce their memory through repetition. This project aims to make that learning experience more interactive and enjoyable.

## **Features**
- **Interactive Flashcards**: Click on a flashcard to flip it and reveal the answer.
- **Simple and Engaging UI**: Designed with a clean interface to make it easy to use.
- **Browser-Based**: No installation is required—just open the HTML file in a web browser.

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML**: Used to create the structure of the flashcards.
- **CSS**: Adds styling to make the flashcards visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Provides interactivity for flipping the cards.

## **How to Run the Project**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

## **How to Use**
- **Click on a Flashcard**: Each card has a question or term on the front. Clicking on it will flip the card to reveal the answer on the back.

## **Future Enhancements**
If more time were available, here are some features that could be added:
- **Additional Flashcards**: Increase the number of flashcards to cover more topics.
